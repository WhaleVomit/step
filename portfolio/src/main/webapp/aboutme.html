      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Lawrence and I am a rising sophomore at  
        Carnegie Mellon University studying computer science. I've 
        lived in Princeton, NJ since 7th grade.

        Some of my hobbies are listening to music and playing video 
        games. I also really enjoy games that require me to think hard, 
        such as Tetris, poker, and Avalon. Recently, I've been playing 
        a bit of chess.

        One of my passions is competitive programming. This year I am a member
        of CMU's ICPC team. ICPC is an international programming contest
        with students from universities all around the world. Out of
        more than 3,000 total universities, CMU is one of the
        128 advancing to the World Finals in Moscow.
