      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Lawrence and I am a rising sophomore at  
        Carnegie Mellon University studying computer science. I've 
        lived in Princeton, NJ since 7th grade.

        Some of my hobbies are listening to music and playing video 
        games. I also enjoy playing board games, such as Poker, Avalon,
        and Chess.

        I also have a cat named Pluto!
