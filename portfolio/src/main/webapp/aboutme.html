      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
          Hello! My name is Lawrence and I am a rising sophomore at  
          Carnegie Mellon University studying computer science. I've 
          lived in Princeton, NJ since 7th grade.

          Some of my hobbies are listening to music and playing video 
          games. I also really enjoy games that require me to think hard, 
          such as Tetris, poker, and Avalon. Recently, I've been playing 
          a bit of chess.

        I also have a cat named Pluto! Click <a href="pluto.html">here</a>
        to see a picture of him.
