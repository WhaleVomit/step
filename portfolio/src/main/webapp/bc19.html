      <h1>Battlecode 2019</h1>
      <p><a href="https://battlecode.org">Battlecode</a> is an annual AI tournament run by MIT. Competitors
         form teams of up to 4 and write bots to compete against one another in themed games. 2019's theme
         was 'Crusade', in which two teams start out with some castles that can produce units to gather resources and
         attack the opponent. A castle that is destroyed cannot be rebuilt. The goal is to have the most castles 
         surviving at the end of the match. Ties are broken by total unit value.
      </p>

        Due to the mechanics of the game, most teams employed defensive strategies that solely defended their own castles
        in hopes of winning in unit value. However, our team devised the infamous "church lightning" strategy which instantly builds
        a long chain of units, allowing us to infiltrate enemy bases in a resource-efficient manner. We were one of the few teams to employ offensive
        tactics in this tournament. Here is a demonstration of church lightning in action:

        Our team name was "Knights of Cowmelot."
        My team members this year were me, Benjamin Qi, Walden Yan, and Chris Pan. We placed 1st in the high school division and 2nd overall.
