      <h1>Chess AI</h1>
      <p>I coded this chess AI in 12th grade. It uses Minimax with several modifications, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alpha-beta pruning (reduces the number of nodes we have to search)</li>
        <li>Killer moves (prioritizes moves in which pieces are taken)</li>
        <li>Iterative deepening (stops evaluating after a certain time limit)</li>
        <li>Advanced evaluation functions (gives an estimate for who is winning and by how much given a board state)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm not very good at chess myself (1100 Lichess rating), so my program was actually able to consistently beat me!</p>
      Here are some screenshots of moves my AI made in certain positions:
