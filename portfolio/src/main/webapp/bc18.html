      <h1>Battlecode 2018</h1>
      <p><a href="https://battlecode.org">Battlecode</a> is an annual AI tournament run by MIT. Competitors
         form teams of up to 4 and write bots to compete against one another in themed games. 2018's theme
         was 'Escape to Mars'. In this game, the goal is to survive for as long as possible. The two
         teams can build robots to gather resources and attack one another. After a certain amount of time,
         Earth will flood, forcing both teams to build rockets and fly to Mars. The last team standing wins.

        of the final round of the high school division:
