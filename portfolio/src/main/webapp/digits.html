      <h1>Handwritten Digit Recognizer</h1>
      <p>
        This project was my first exposure to artifical intelligence.
        I used Java to implement a neural network and trained it to
        recognize 32x32 black and white images of handwritten digits.
        No libraries were used in the process; everything down to
        matrix multiplication were coded from scratch. The finished
        program achieved accuracies of about 70% for distinguishing
        between the 10 digits.
